The purpose of the study was to compare the accuracy of neural models with that of traditional statistical models in predicting the etch rate, uniformity, and selectivity of n+-doped polysilicon in a CCI/02 plasma. The experiment was conducted using a Lam Research Autoetch 490 single-wafer plasma system. The results showed that the neural models were more accurate than the traditional statistical models in predicting the etch rate, uniformity, and selectivity.

A study was conducted to determine the most significant parameters affecting the poly etch rate. The experiment was divided into two phases: an initial variable screening phase to determine the most significant parameters, followed by a second phase designed to obtain the statistical response models. The six input factors and their respective ranges of variation were identified in the first phase. A fractional factorial design requiring only 32 runs was performed. Experimental runs were performed in two blocks of 16 trials each in such a way that no main effects or first order interactions were confounded. Three center points were added to the design to provide a check for model nonlinearity. The experimental sequence was randomized in order to avoid biases due to equipment aging during the experiment. The second phase of the experiment employed a Central Composite Circumscribed (CCC) Box-Wilson design. In this design, the 2-level factorial "box" was enhanced by further replicated experiments at the center as well as symmetrically located "star" points. A complete CCC design for six factors requires a total of 91 runs. To reduce the size of the experiment and combine it with the results from the screening phase, a half fractional factorial design was used, resulting in a total of 46 runs.

The study used a replicate design and found that the quadratic models best described the interaction between input factors and the four responses. Neural networks were used to model the complex manufacturing process, and the feed-forward error back-propagation algorithm was found to be effective in learning the relationships between the input parameters and corresponding responses.

The FFEBP neural network is used to model plasma etching processes. It consists of six input neurons, six hidden neurons, and four output neurons. The network is trained on a subset of experimental data, and then tested on remaining data. Training is complete when all outputs are within a previously defined tolerance of the training data.

The FFEBP algorithm is used in Brainmaker and Bruinmaker to predict the response of plasma etch equipment with an experimental error of 6. The use of a training tolerance in Bruinmaker speeds up network training but causes a small trade-off in accuracy.

Neural networks are more accurate than regression models in predicting etch behavior, and can do so with fewer training runs. This makes them more useful in industrial settings, where precise predictions are necessary and experiments are expensive.

Neural network modeling was applied to the complex process of plasma etching, and was found to be significantly more accurate than traditional Response Surface Methodology. Neural network modeling is thus a more efficient and less expensive method of process characterization.
