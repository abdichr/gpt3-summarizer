RESPONSE:

A study was conducted to determine the most significant parameters affecting the poly etch rate. The experiment was divided into two phases: an initial variable screening phase to determine the most significant parameters, followed by a second phase designed to obtain the statistical response models. The six input factors and their respective ranges of variation were identified in the first phase. A fractional factorial design requiring only 32 runs was performed. Experimental runs were performed in two blocks of 16 trials each in such a way that no main effects or first order interactions were confounded. Three center points were added to the design to provide a check for model nonlinearity. The experimental sequence was randomized in order to avoid biases due to equipment aging during the experiment. The second phase of the experiment employed a Central Composite Circumscribed (CCC) Box-Wilson design. In this design, the 2-level factorial "box" was enhanced by further replicated experiments at the center as well as symmetrically located "star" points. A complete CCC design for six factors requires a total of 91 runs. To reduce the size of the experiment and combine it with the results from the screening phase, a half fractional factorial design was used, resulting in a total of 46 runs.
