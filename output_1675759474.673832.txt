This paper discusses the use of neural networks for modeling the removal of polysilicon films by plasma etching. The authors compare the neural network approach to the statistical response surface approach and find that the former is more accurate and requires fewer training experiments.

Two different neural network modeling methodologies are applied to the removal of polysilicon films by plasma etching. In one case, a neural modeling algorithm is implemented via a C program, while in the second case, neural process models are developed using the commercially available Brainmaker software package.

The study found that neural models are more accurate than RSM models in predicting etch rates, uniformity, and selectivity to both silicon dioxide and photoresist. The neural models require fewer training experiments.

The study looked at the effect of six input factors on the poly etch rate. A full factorial experiment would have required 64 runs, so a fractional factorial design was used instead, requiring only 32 runs. The results showed significant nonlinearity in all responses, indicating the need for quadratic models. A second experiment was performed using a Central Composite Circumscribed (CCC) Box-Wilson design, which required a total of 91 runs. The results from this experiment were combined with the results from the first experiment to create the final RSM models.

The study employed a replicate design and found that the quadratic models yielded by the second phase of the experiment were valid and had a good fit. Analysis of variance techniques supported the validity and quality of fit of each model. Neural networks were used to model the complex manufacturing process, and the feed-forward error back-propagation algorithm was found to be effective in learning the relationships between the input parameters and responses.

This article discusses the use of the FFEBP neural network algorithm for modeling plasma etch processes. The algorithm is implemented in both a C program and commercially available software, and is trained on a subset of available experimental data. The network is then tested on remaining data.

The FFEBP algorithm is used in both Brainmaker and Bruinmaker to train neural networks. Both programs are able to accurately predict responses with an experimental error of 6. The use of a training tolerance in Bruinmaker speeds up network training but causes a small trade-off in accuracy.

The neural network models were found to be more accurate than the RSM models, due to the fact that the RSM models were based on the somewhat arbitrary assumption of quadratic behavior. The neural models were not constrained to any particular form, and were able to interpolate and generalize arbitrary nonlinear relationships. The neural models also exhibited superior predictive capability with fewer training experiments than the RSM models.

A neural network modeling technique has been applied to the highly complex process of plasma etching. For a polysilicon etch in a CCl&Ie/O, plasma, the etch rate, uniformity, and selectivity to both silicon dioxide and photoresist were modeled as a function of RF power, pressure, electrode spacing, and the three gas flows. Neural process models were subsequently compared to models derived by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for the same data. It was demonstrated that the neural models possess significantly superior performance. Furthermore, the derivation of accurate neural models was shown to require fewer training experiments. As a result, neural network modeling promises to be a faster, more efficient and less expensive method of process characterization and the RSM approach in the future.
